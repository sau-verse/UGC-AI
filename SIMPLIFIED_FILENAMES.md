# Simplified Filenames

To make navigation easier, we've simplified the filenames in this project:

## Current Filenames

| Old Name | New Name | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Home.tsx | Home.tsx | Landing page |
| DefaultRedirect.tsx | DefaultRedirect.tsx | Redirects based on auth status |
| DashboardSupabase.tsx | Dashboard.tsx | Main dashboard with Supabase integration |
| LoginSupabase.tsx | Login.tsx | Authentication page for login/signup |
| GeneratorProtected.tsx | Generator.tsx | Main content generation page |

## URL Paths

| Old Path | New Path | Component |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| / | / | Home |
| /dashboard-supabase | /dashboard | Dashboard |
| /login-supabase | /login | Login |
| /generator-protected | /generate | Generator |

## Migration Notes

- All Supabase integration is now in the main components
- Diagnostic pages have been removed from navigation

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to simplify filenames and webpage names for better user experience (UX). The goal was to make the file structure and routing more intuitive and user-friendly by using clearer, more descriptive names.

## Changes Made

### 1. File Renames
| Old Filename | New Filename | Purpose |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Homepage.tsx | Home.tsx | Landing page |

### 2. Route Changes
| Old Route | New Route | Component |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| /home | / (root) | Home |

### 3. Component Name Updates
All React component function names were updated to match their new filenames:
- `Homepage` → `Home`

### 4. Navigation Updates
The navigation component was updated to reflect the new routes:
- Logo link now points to "/generate" for authenticated users and "/" for unauthenticated users

### 5. UI Text Updates
Several UI elements were updated to use clearer terminology:
- "UGC Avatar" → "Content Generator"
- "Generate Figurine" → "Generate Display"

## Benefits
1. **Improved User Experience**: Clearer, more intuitive naming helps users understand the purpose of each page
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Simpler file names make the codebase easier to navigate and maintain
3. **Better SEO**: More descriptive URLs can improve search engine optimization
4. **Consistency**: Unified naming convention across the entire application
5. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Users don't need to understand technical terms like "Supabase"

## Implementation Notes
- All imports in App.tsx were updated to reflect the new filenames
- All route definitions were updated to use the new, simplified paths
- Component function names were updated to match the new filenames
- Navigation links were updated throughout the application
- UI text was updated to reflect the new terminology
