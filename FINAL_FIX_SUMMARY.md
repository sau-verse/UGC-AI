# Real-time Video Job Status Updates - Final Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Filter for Real-time Updates**: The UPDATE event listener was missing the filter, causing it to receive updates for ALL video jobs instead of just the specific job
2. **Missing INSERT Event Listener**: The hook now also listens for INSERT events in case the job is created after the component mounts
3. **Improved Status Logging**: Added better logging for subscription status to help with debugging

## Changes Made

### File: `src/hooks/supabase/useVideoJobStatusRealtime.ts`

1. **Added Filter to UPDATE Event**:
   ```typescript
   filter: `video_job_id=eq.${jobId}` // ✅ Add filter to only receive updates for this specific job
   ```

2. **Added INSERT Event Listener**:
   ```typescript
   .on(
     "postgres_changes",
     {
       event: "INSERT",
       schema: "public",
       table: "video_jobs",
       filter: `video_job_id=eq.${jobId}`, // ✅ Add filter for INSERT events too
     },
     (payload) => {
       console.log("Realtime video job INSERT received:", payload.new);
       const newJob = payload.new as VideoJobStatus;
       setJob(newJob);
     }
   )
   ```

3. **Enhanced Status Logging**:
   ```typescript
   .subscribe((status) => {
     console.log("Realtime subscription status:", status);
     if (status === "SUBSCRIBED") {
       console.log("✅ Successfully subscribed to real-time updates for video job:", jobId);
     } else if (status === "CHANNEL_ERROR") {
       console.error("❌ Error subscribing to real-time updates for video job:", jobId);
     }
   });
   ```

## How It Works Now

1. When a video job is created, the hook subscribes to real-time updates for that specific job
2. It listens for both INSERT and UPDATE events, but only for the specific job (filtered by video_job_id)
3. When the backend updates the job status to "done" with a video URL, the frontend receives the update
4. The UI automatically re-renders to show the generated video

## Verification

To verify that the fix is working:

1. Create a video job in the Generator page
2. Monitor the browser console for these log messages:
   - "✅ Successfully subscribed to real-time updates for video job: [job-id]"
   - "Realtime video job UPDATE received:" when the job status changes
   - "Video job completed ✅" when the job completes
   - "New video URL:" with the video URL

3. The video should now automatically appear in the preview area when the job completes
