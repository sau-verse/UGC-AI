# Fixed Real-time Implementation Patch

This document shows how to fix the current real-time implementation by properly using the filter in the Supabase subscription.

## Issue Summary

The current implementation has the filter commented out, which causes it to receive updates for ALL video jobs and then filter them client-side. This is inefficient and can lead to missed updates.

## Solution

Re-enable the filter in the Supabase subscription to only receive updates for the specific job we're interested in.

## File: src/hooks/supabase/useVideoJobStatusRealtime.ts

### Changes to make:

**Find this section (around line 100-105):**
```typescript
event: "UPDATE",
schema: "public",
table: "video_jobs",
// Remove the filter to see if we receive updates at all
// filter: `video_job_id=eq.${jobId}`, // Use video_job_id instead of id
```

**Replace with:**
```typescript
event: "UPDATE",
schema: "public",
table: "video_jobs",
filter: `video_job_id=eq.${jobId}`, // Properly filter for this specific job
```

## Alternative: Use the Fixed Implementation

Instead of modifying the existing file, you can replace the import in Generator.tsx to use the fixed implementation:

### File: src/pages/Generator.tsx

**Find:**
```typescript
import { useVideoJobStatusRealtime } from '@/hooks/supabase/useVideoJobStatusRealtime'
```

**Replace with:**
```typescript
import { useVideoJobStatusRealtimeFixed as useVideoJobStatusRealtime } from '@/hooks/supabase/useVideoJobStatusRealtimeFixed'
```

This approach allows you to use the fixed implementation while keeping the same variable name and interface, minimizing other code changes.

## Verification

After making the change:

1. Create a video job in the Generator
2. Check that the console shows "[FIXED RT] Successfully subscribed to video job updates"
3. When the job completes, verify that you see "[FIXED RT] Realtime video job UPDATE received" with the completed job data
4. Confirm that the video URL is properly extracted and displayed

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Efficiency**: Only receives updates for the specific job instead of all jobs
2. **Reliability**: Proper filtering at the database level reduces chance of missed updates
3. **Performance**: Less network traffic and client-side processing
4. **Simplicity**: Removes the need for manual filtering in the client code
