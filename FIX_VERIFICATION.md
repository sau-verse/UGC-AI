# Fix Verification

## Issue Summary
The real-time updates for video job status were not working because the Supabase subscription filter was commented out, causing the frontend to receive updates for ALL video jobs and then manually filter them.

## Fix Applied
1. Uncommented the filter in the Supabase subscription to properly filter for the specific job
2. Removed redundant client-side filtering code since the database now properly filters the updates

## How to Test the Fix

1. Create a video job in the Generator page
2. Monitor the browser console for these log messages:
   - "Successfully subscribed to video job updates" (should appear immediately)
   - "Realtime video job UPDATE received" (should appear when the job status changes)
   - "Status changed to done" (should appear when the job completes)
   - "Found generated_video_url in update" (should appear with the video URL)

3. When the job completes, the video should automatically appear in the preview area

## Expected Behavior After Fix

Before the fix:
- Job would remain in "queued" status indefinitely in the UI
- No real-time updates would be received when the job completed
- Video would not display even after completion

After the fix:
- Real-time updates are received immediately when job status changes
- UI updates to show "processing" status
- When job completes, UI updates to show the generated video
- Video automatically appears in the preview area

## Technical Details

The fix ensures that:
1. Only relevant updates are sent from the database (efficiency)
2. No race conditions or missed updates (reliability)
3. Proper separation of concerns (database handles filtering)
4. Cleaner client-side code (removal of redundant checks)
